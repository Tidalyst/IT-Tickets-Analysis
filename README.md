# IT-Help_Desk-Analysis

## Project Overview 
The IT Department, responsible for managing internal support requests, aims to improve service delivery by strengthening how tickets are monitored and resolved. This project analyzes IT ticket data to uncover workload patterns across days, identify recurring issue types, evaluate SLA compliance, and assess agent efficiency. The findings provide actionable insights to optimize resource allocation, improve accountability, and enhance end-user satisfaction.



## Project Statement
The IT Department faces challenges such as uneven ticket inflow, recurring request backlogs, and inconsistent SLA compliance. Some agents are overburdened while others handle fewer tickets, creating inefficiencies and delays in resolution. Without a structured framework for analyzing support tickets, management lacks the visibility needed to optimize performance, ensure SLA adherence, and deliver timely, reliable IT support.



# Data Source: 
The dataset was sourced from the **FP20 IT Help Desk Analysis Challenge 8**. It is provided in a workbook containing two sheets:

â€¢ **Tickets:** 97,498 records with 10 fields.

â€¢ **IT Agents:** 50 records with 6 fields.

## Business Questions
â€¢ On which days of the week do we experience the highest volume of IT tickets?

â€¢ Is ticket inflow evenly distributed, or are there peak workload periods?

â€¢ Which System Request Categories and Issue Types generate the most tickets?

â€¢ Are there recurring issues that account for a majority of support requests?

â€¢ What percentage of tickets meet the Service Level Agreement (SLA) benchmark?

â€¢ Which categories or issue types are most likely to breach SLA compliance?

â€¢ Are delays linked to specific days, request types, or agents?

â€¢ How are tickets distributed among support agents?

â€¢ Which agents resolve tickets most efficiently?

â€¢ Are there gaps in workload allocation that affect team performance?

â€¢ How can insights from ticket analysis help the IT Department allocate resources better?

â€¢ What steps can be taken to improve SLA compliance and reduce delays?

â€¢ Which recurring issues should be prioritized for process or system improvements?
